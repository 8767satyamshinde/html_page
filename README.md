# Single-Page CV using HTML

This project is a simple, semantic, single-page CV created using only HTML. The goal is to present the information in a clean, structured, and easy-to-read format.



### Explanation of the `README.md` Sections:

1. **Project Page URL**:  
   This section provides the live URL of your project hosted on GitHub Pages.
   
2. **Steps to Run the Project Locally**:  
   This section explains how others can clone the repository and view the project locally on their own machines.

3. **Project Structure**:  
   It outlines the file structure of the repository to help others understand where to find the key files.

4. **Technologies Used**:  
   It lists the technologies used in the project, which in this case is only HTML.

5. **Contributing**:  
   Explains how others can contribute to the project, either by forking or submitting a pull request.

6. **License**:  
   Provides licensing information (you can add the appropriate license file if needed).

### Next Steps:
- Save the `README.md` file to the project repository.
- Push the changes to GitHub:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Added README file"
git push origin main
